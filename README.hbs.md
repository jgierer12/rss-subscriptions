# My RSS subscriptions

List of my active RSS subscriptions. I currently use
[Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) to read them.

Use the `subscriptions.xml` OMPL file to import them into your favorite feed
reader.

For newsletters that aren't available as RSS feeds, I'm using
https://www.kill-the-newsletter.com/. Please be nice and don't mess with my
E-Mail subscriptions :wink:.
