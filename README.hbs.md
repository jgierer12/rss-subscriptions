# My RSS subscriptions

List of my active RSS subscriptions. I currently use
[Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) to read them.

Use the `subscriptions.xml` OMPL file to import them into your favorite feed
reader.

## E-Mail newsletters

The following newsletters don't have RSS feeds, so I'm subscribing to them
through Feedbin's E-Mail newsletter support.

- [ProductHunt Weekly](https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/weekly)
- [Egghead Newsletter](https://egghead.io)
- [Typewolf Tuesday](https://www.typewolf.com/newsletter)

## Actions

Feedbin supports actions, which allow you to further tweak your feeds based on
simple rules.

Since these can't be exported, I'll manually transcribe them here:
